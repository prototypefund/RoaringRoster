/**
 * Behavior value for QSelect components. It defines whetther the QSelect options are 
 * displayed as a simple menu popup in their current context or presented as a modal dialog.
 * We prefer the menu popup because of it's simplicity and also because the QSelect input has 
 * no autofocus on iOS when presented as modal dialog, because iOS does not support autofocus,
 * which means the keyboard is not displayed automatically and the user has to tap the input
 * twice to enter text which feels quite inconvenient.
 * At the same time, every iOS version below iOS 16.4 had a CSS bug with position:fixed
 * which leads to even more inconvenient behavior so that a modal dialog is an acceptable
 * workaround.
 * For all these reasons our strategy is to override Quasar's default behavior and
 * always display the options as menu popup for mobile and desktop platforms, 
 * except for iOS 16.3 and earlier where we use the modal dialog as fallback.
 * @returns `menu` or `default`. `default` means, the QSelect options are displayed as
 * modal dialog on mobile platforms and as simple menu popup for desktop platforms. 
 * `menu` ensures that the options are always displayed as menu popup.
