<p>The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve the user experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.</p>
<p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>
<p>I. Information about us as controllers of your data<br>II. The rights of users and data subjects<br>III. Information about the data processing<br>IV. General notes</p>

<h2>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h2>
<p>With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right</p>
<ul type="disc">

<li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);</li>
<li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 GDPR), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;</li>
<li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);</li>
<li>to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR.
